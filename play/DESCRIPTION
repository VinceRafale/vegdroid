Experimental app to find nearby vegetarian and vegan restaurants (and other venues) by accessing the pool of 15,000 listings in 150 countries kindly provided by https://vegguide.org.

Please be aware that at the present time, the app only provides basic functionality.  It is made available in an early stage of development following the "release early, release often" paradigm.  Your feedback is much appreciated, but please be gentle when rating the app and keep in mind that in essence, you're looking at a technology preview, not at a finalized product!

VegDroid is free and without ads and will always remain so.  Source code is made available through GitHub.  Patches and pull requests are welcome!

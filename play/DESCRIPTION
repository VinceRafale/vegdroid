VegDroid (working title) is an experimental app to locate nearby vegetarian and vegan restaurants (and other venues) from the pool of 15,000 listings in 150 countries kindly provided by http://vegguide.org. 

Please be aware that at the present time, the app only provides basic functionality.  It is made available in an early stage of development following the "release early, release often" paradigm.  Your feedback is much appreciated, but please be gentle when rating the app and keep in mind that in essence, you're looking at a technology preview, not at a finalized product!

VegDroid is free and will always remain free.  Source code is made available.
